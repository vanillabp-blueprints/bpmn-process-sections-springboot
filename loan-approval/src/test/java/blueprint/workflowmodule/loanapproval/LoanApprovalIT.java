/**
 * The integration test of this workflow module: it starts a real workflow in a real BPMS
 * and waits for the process to have done its work.
 *
 * <p>
 * The aspect under test is what a section leaves behind. A small loan skips the second
 * section, so its aggregate has to reach a decision with that section's sub-object still
 * {@code null}. A test which only ran the big loans would be green while every small loan
 * was stuck.
