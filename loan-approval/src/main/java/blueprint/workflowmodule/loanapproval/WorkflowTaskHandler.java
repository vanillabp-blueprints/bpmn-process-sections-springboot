/**
 * What the processes tell the application: the incoming half of the BPMN wiring.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a driving adapter, the same kind of thing as {@link ApiController}: something
 * outside triggers, and the trigger is translated into a call to {@link Service}. That the
 * caller is a BPMS rather than a browser changes nothing about the direction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Two sections, one handler.</strong> The first section is the called process
 * {@code document_check}, the second one is an embedded subprocess of
 * {@code loan_approval}, and the methods below serve both. Nothing marks a method as
 * belonging to a section: a task of a section is a task like any other, and it is handed
 * the same workflow aggregate.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code secondaryBpmnProcesses} names the called process. Put it here rather than into a
 * workflow service class of its own: VanillaBP builds one {@code ProcessService} per
 * workflow aggregate class, and with a second class on the same aggregate
 * {@code startWorkflow} may start the called process instead of the loan approval.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There is no {@code @Transactional} here, and adding one would be a mistake. VanillaBP
 * loads the aggregate, runs the method and saves the aggregate in one transaction it owns,
 * and it commits that transaction for a {@code TaskException} on purpose. A transaction
 * declared by the application would roll back instead and throw away what the handler
 * wrote for the process to react to. VanillaBP does not let that happen unnoticed: such an
 * annotation on this class or on a {@code @WorkflowTask} method fails the boot naming the
 * method, and one on a bean further down the call chain fails the task while it runs.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/vanillabp/spi-for-java#wire-up-a-process">Wire up a
 *      process</a>
